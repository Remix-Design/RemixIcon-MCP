## Architecture Overview

### Core Structure
This is a **Cloudflare Workers MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that provides intelligent icon search and recommendation services for Remix Icons. The architecture follows domain-driven design principles.

### Key Components

**Main Entry Point (`src/index.ts`)**
- `RemixIconMCP` class extends `WorkerEntrypoint` 
- Provides three main methods: `findIcons()`, `getIconCategories()`, `findIconsByCategory()`
- Uses dependency injection pattern with `createSearchService()` factory

**Domain Layer (`src/domain/`)**
- **Icon Domain**: Type definitions and models for icon metadata
- **Search Domain**: Complete search functionality including:
  - Search configuration with weights, thresholds, and boosts
  - Multi-level caching with LRU strategy
  - Inverted index for fast preliminary search
  - Scorer service with multiple similarity algorithms
  - Query processing and enhancement

**Search Architecture**
- **Two-tier search strategy**: Fast inverted index for preliminary results, then detailed scoring
- **Multi-algorithm similarity matching**: Jaccard, N-gram, Levenshtein, category matching, exact matching
- **Semantic query enhancement**: Enriches queries with related terms
- **Configurable scoring**: Weights and thresholds defined in `DEFAULT_SEARCH_CONFIG`

**Infrastructure Layer (`src/infrastructure/`)**
- Logging with configurable log levels
- Result handling with success/failure patterns

**Utilities (`src/utils/`)**
- Text processing for normalization and Chinese/English text handling
- Similarity calculations with semantic vectors
- Multiple similarity algorithms implementation

### Data Flow
1. Icon tags loaded from `src/data/tags.json`
2. Inverted index built on service initialization
3. Search requests processed through query enhancement → index search → detailed scoring → caching
4. Results returned with relevance scores and categories

### Performance Features
- **Hybrid caching**: Cloudflare Cache API with in-memory LRU for hot data
- **Streaming search**: Memory-efficient batch processing to avoid 128MB Worker limits
- **KV storage**: Icon catalog and search indexes stored in Cloudflare KV for persistence
- **Inverted index**: Fast preliminary search before detailed scoring
- **Configurable thresholds**: Minimum score (0.08), high score (0.3), secondary results (0.1)
- **Concurrent batch processing**: Parallel processing with memory management

## Configuration

### Search Configuration (`src/domain/search/config/`)
All search behavior is controlled by `DEFAULT_SEARCH_CONFIG`:
- **Weights**: Category (0.35), Name match (0.37), Tags (0.28), etc.
- **Thresholds**: High score (0.3), minimum score (0.05), secondary (0.1)
- **Boosts**: Exact match (2.4), name match (2.2), category match (2.2)
- **Cache settings**: Max size 1000, TTL 1 hour

### Cloudflare Workers (`wrangler.jsonc`)

- "Hi" command provides codebase analysis

## Key Implementation Patterns
- **Domain-driven design** with clear separation of concerns
- **Dependency injection** throughout service layer
- **Result pattern** for error handling instead of exceptions
- **Factory pattern** for service creation
